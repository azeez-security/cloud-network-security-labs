## Overview

This repository contains a **full security transformation journey** for a cloud banking platform, implemented as four flagship projects:

| Layer | Project | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 🌐 Network | **Project 1: Zero-Trust Micro-Segmentation** | Secure VPC tiers & enforce least privilege between services |
| 🛡 Threat Defense | **Project 2: XDR + SOAR** | Detect & auto-respond to ransomware, API fraud, insider threats |
| 🔐 API Security | **Project 3: Fraud & Bot Defense** | Protect online banking APIs from bots, carding, and abuse |
| 🔑 Identity + Data | **Project 4: CIEM + Tokenization** | Reduce overprivilege & protect financial/PII data via tokens |

All projects are built with Terraform and designed to be **realistic for financial institutions** in Canada and the U.S.

## Multi-Region Security Design

To emulate banking best practices, the lab uses multiple AWS regions:

| Region | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `us-east-1` | Primary production workloads (VPC, APIs, EC2, DBs) |
| `us-west-2` | Disaster Recovery (cold/standby resources) |
| `ca-central-1` | **Forensic audit vault** for immutable logs (`cloud-soc-forensics-ca`) |

This aligns with regulatory expectations (OSFI B-13, PCI DSS 4.0, FFIEC/NYDFS) for:
- Segregated logging  
- Forensic evidence integrity  
- Business continuity and cyber-resilience

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network          | VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Security Groups, Transit Gateway (design)                                |
| Threat Detection | GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, AWS Config, WAF logs                                           |
| SOAR Automation  | EventBridge, Lambda, SNS (alerts), tags & quarantine patterns                                        |
| Logging / SIEM   | CloudWatch Logs, Amazon Security Lake, S3 (`cloud-soc-forensics-ca`), OpenSearch Dashboards (design) |
| Data Protection  | KMS, IAM Access Analyzer, SCP-style guardrails (patterns), tokenization via DynamoDB + Lambda        |

**Skills Outcomes (Resume / Interview)**

This portfolio demonstrates:

✔ Zero-Trust design & network micro-segmentation (multi-AZ VPC)

✔ Real-world XDR/SOAR automation & Lambda runbooks

✔ API fraud prevention & bot mitigation (WAF + API Gateway)

✔ CIEM-style IAM controls & data tokenization strategy

✔ Multi-region forensic & compliance logging design

✔ Terraform modular Infrastructure as Code for security programs

Interview-ready narratives are included in each project’s README.

**Threat Scenarios Covered**

| Threat Type       | Example Scenario                                    | Mitigation                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔴 Ransomware     | EC2 host scanning and encrypting east-west          | GuardDuty + Flow Logs + Lambda quarantine playbook           |
| 🔵 API Fraud      | Credential stuffing & carding on login/payment APIs | WAF rules, rate limiting, SOAR IP block & token freeze       |
| 🟡 Insider Misuse | IAM user escalating privileges or exfiltrating data | CloudTrail + IAM Analyzer + SOAR deactivation & key rotation |

Forensics are exported to the cloud-soc-forensics-ca S3 bucket in ca-central-1 with stricter controls than production.

---
**Next Enhancements (In This Repo)**
Terraform Security Enhancements (Guardrails)

Planned guardrails include:

SCP-style constraints (patterns) to prevent:

Disabling CloudTrail / GuardDuty / Security Lake

Deleting the forensic S3 bucket or logs

Creating wildcard AdministratorAccess-style roles

Making logging buckets public

KMS key separation:

Forensic logs encrypted with a CMK that app roles cannot decrypt

SOC Dashboard – Security Lake + OpenSearch

Planned SOC visualization:

Ingest CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, WAF logs, GuardDuty findings into Security Lake

Use OpenSearch Dashboards (or Athena) to visualize:

Attack timelines

Quarantined resources

Fraud/anomaly IPs

IAM privilege abuse events

### 🔐 Security Automation

This repository enforces production-grade cloud security governance:

| Control | Enforced By |
|---------|-------------|
| Dependency patching (patch-only) | Dependabot |
| IaC vulnerability scanning | GitHub CodeQL |
| Secret leak prevention | GitHub Secret Scanning |
| Responsible vulnerability reporting | Security Policy |
| Controlled disclosure | Security Advisories |

> All changes are treated as **Zero-Trust IaC deployments** and require governance review.

### OPA Guardrails – Encryption Enforcement

This portfolio treats Terraform plans like a production banking environment.

- Every PR runs an **OPA (Open Policy Agent)** policy that inspects the Terraform plan.
- Any **unencrypted S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS instances, or Lambda environments** cause the PR to fail.
- Violations are exported as JSON evidence to `soc-evidence/policy-violations/opa-encryption-violations.json`
  and uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact for SOC review.

This demonstrates how a financial institution could hard-stop insecure changes
before they ever reach the cloud.
